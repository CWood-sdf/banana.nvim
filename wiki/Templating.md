## Templating

Currently, the only templating supported is a very simple character substitution via the % character.

```html
<!-- this div will display as "foo" -->
<div asdf="foo">%asdf</div>
```

The templating capabilities might expand in the future, but right now, building documents can be done with scripts so it's not very high on the todo list
