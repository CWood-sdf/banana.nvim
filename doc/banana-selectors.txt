SELECTORS                                         *banana-selectors-selectors*

Banana currently supports the following minimal list of selectors:

- The universal selector (`*`)
- Descendant selectors (a space between two other selectors)
- Tag name selectors
- child selectors (`>`)
- id selectors
- class selectors
- Pseudo classes (currently only supporting `:not`, `:first-child`, `:last-child`, `:nth-of-type`, and `:nth-child`)

>css
    /* universal selector. selects all elements on page */
    * {
    }
    /* descendant. selects all elements that have two divs in their ancestry list */
    div div * {
    }
    
    /* tag name */
    div {
    }
    
    /* child selectors. selects all divs that have their parent a div */
    div > div {
    }

PSEUDO CLASSES                               *banana-selectors-pseudo-classes*


:NOT(SELECTOR) ~

`:not` selects any of the elements that do not match the given selector:

>css
    /* selects any element that has a div parent, but is not a div */
    div > :not(span) {
    }
<

>html
    <div>
      <div>not selected</div>
      <span> selected </span>
    </div>
<


:FIRST-CHILD ~

Selects any element that is the first child of its parent


:LAST-CHILD ~

Selects any element that is the last child of its parent


:NTH-CHILD(AN+B) ~

Selects any element that matches the equation. See mdn documentation
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-child> for more info


:NTH-OF-TYPE(AN+B) ~

This one has a little bit of weird behavior that differs from the css spec. It
filters the input element list without caring about sibling relationships or
anything
