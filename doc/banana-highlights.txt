Highlights are done via the `hl-*` ncss properties that can be applied to
elements.

For example, if you want to make all divâ€™s red background, then use the
following style rule:

>css
    div {
      hl-bg: red;
    }
<

The property names given are passed directly to `nvim_set_hl`, so you can check
`:help nvim_set_hl` to use those highlights.


HL-__NAME                                        *banana-highlights-hl-__name*

There is one additional property that can be added: `hl-__name`. This allows
highlights groups to be named, and overriden by the user.

>css
    div {
      hl-bg: red;
      hl-__name: Override;
    }
<

This will set all divs background to be red unless this is called somewhere in
lua:

>lua
    vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, "Override", {
      bg = "blue"
    })
<


GRADIENTS                                        *banana-highlights-gradients*

Currently, linear and radial gradients are supported. Unlike in html, gradients
can be applied both as a background _and_ foreground value

For `linear-gradient` every parameter possibility except for color space input
are supported. The mdn documentation
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gradient/linear-gradient>
should clarify any questions

For `radial-gradient`, the shape, size, and position parameters are not
supported currently. See mdn docs
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gradient/radial-gradient> for
more help.

Banana also does not support passing multiple gradients to one color field

>css
    div {
      /* This is not allowed */
      hl-bg: linear-gradient(45deg, orange, blue)
        linear-gradient(90deg, white, black);
    }
<

>nml
    <nml>
      <head>
        <style>
        div {
          width: 40ch;
          height: 20ch;
          hl-bg: linear-gradient(45deg, orange, blue);
        }
        </style>
      </head>
      <body>
      <div> gradient </div>
      </body>
    </nml>
<

the above code looks like:
